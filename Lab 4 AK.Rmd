## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Key observations :

Urban really slopes population density, taxpc, and crimerate. So may be an important indicator variable / interaction with some of these variables that show up as significant.


```{r models}
(model1 <- lm(crmrte~density, data = data)) #picked density as the first variable as it shows the most correlation.
summary(model1) 
plot(model1) # model does not meet MLR 4', and MLR 5,6
plot(model1$fitted.values,data$crmrte)

(model1a <- lm(crmrte~log(density), data = data))
summary(model1a) 
plot(model1a)   # model does not meet MLR 4 or 4' though heteroskedasticity reduces substantially.
plot(model1a$fitted.values,data$crmrte)

(model1b <- lm(log(crmrte)~density, data = data))
summary(model1b) 
plot(model1b) # model does not meet MLR 4', and MLR 5,6
plot(model1b$fitted.values,data$crmrte)

(model1c <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density), data = data))
summary(model1c) 
plot(model1c) # log-log model follows MLR 4,5,6 much better than the non-trandformed or log-level, level-log values. So further analysis builds on this.
plot(model1c$fitted.values,data$crmrte) 

(model2 <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density)+taxpc, data = data)) #trying taxpc as the second variable as within set of next highest correlations.
summary(model2)
plot(model2) 
waldtest(model1c, model2, vcov = vcovHC) # while it improves r-square (0.48 to 0.53, not significant in F-test. P-value ~ 0.09)

(model2a <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density)+urban+urban*log(density), data = data)) #trying urban as a variable as also high correlation
summary(model2a)
plot(model2a) 
waldtest(model1c, model2a, vcov = vcovHC) # neither individual urban co-eff or overall F-test is significant. Effect is probably picked up in the density function.

(model3 <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density)+prbarr+prbconv, data = data)) #tried all 4 of the variables that point to consequence of crim - ie probability of being arrested, convicted, prison, and average sentence. Only the first we had significant p-values, and overall had significant F-test. So kept the first two and that is model 2.
summary(model3) # R-square improved to 0.64
plot(model3)
waldtest(model1c, model3, vcov = vcovHC) 

(model4 <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density)+prbarr+prbconv+pctmin80+pctymle+totwage+west+central+polpc, data = data)) #trying remaining variables that seemed to have meaningful correlation. 
summary(model4) # R-square improved to 0.85. pctmin80, polpc clearly significant. central marginally significant. Rest additional variables not significant.
plot(model4)
waldtest(model3, model4, vcov = vcovHC) #sum total of additions leads to significant improvement.

(model4a <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density)+prbarr+prbconv+pctmin80+central+polpc, data = data)) #model that takes out individually non-significant variables from previous all inclusive model.
summary(model4a) # R square drops very marginally to 0.84
plot(model4a) # couple of data points that are outliers also are showing up as material cook's distance ie high influence.
waldtest(model4a, model4, vcov = vcovHC) # F test vs removed variables shows that the additional variables were not jointly significant.
waldtest(model3, model4a, vcov = vcovHC) # however, the variables that have been kept vs model 3 are jointly significant.

datan = data[-c(25,51),]
(model4b <- lm(log(crmrte)~log(density)+prbarr+prbconv+pctmin80+central+polpc, data = datan)) #restimating the model co-efficients without the two outlier observations.
summary(model4b)
plot(model4b)

(m_density <- mean(log(data$density)))
(m_prbarr <-mean(data$prbarr))

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
